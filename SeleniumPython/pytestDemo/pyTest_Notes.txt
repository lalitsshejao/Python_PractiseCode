>>> All the pytest file should start with "test_" or ends with "_test"
>>> pytest method name should start with "test"
>>> Code should be wrapped inside the method only
>>> Method name should have some proper sense (Meaningfull name)

>>> To run a specific file py.test <file name (along with path)> (py.test filename)

>>>
-k => method name execution i.e. method name having that word will be executed.
-v => more info Metadata
-s => log output

py.test -k CreditCard -v -s => all the test methods having CreditCard word in it will be executed.

>>> Add the tag to the test case (method) {import pytest - above the test case(method) add @pytest.mark.<tagName>}
eg:
@pytest.mark.smoke
def test_demo():
>>> To execute the marked test cases =>> py.test -m smoke -s -v

>>> To skip the test case (Method) use @pytest.mark.skip tag above the Method
eg:
@pytest.mark.skip
def test_demo():

==> py.test -s -v  => All the test will be executed except which are marked as "skip"

>>> Execute the test case but don't show the status of execution as Pass / Fail then add the below tag
@pytest.mark.xfail
(this scenario will come when we want to run the test case irrespective of its status
as it act as the prerequisite for the next test case)

Fixture is like setup and teardown (do this once the test is done) method for the test cases.
Fixture can be defined in conftest.py file, so that it will be available for all the test cases,
